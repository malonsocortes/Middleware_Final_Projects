- threshold that is created is always very low, near the minimum which is 30. The
max temp is 70. Ideally, the threshold should be closer to 70.
threshold calculated: threshold = (call Random.rand16() % 40) + 30;
Measured temperature: temperature = (call Random.rand16()%70);


- Infinite loops in flooding protocol. What is happening is that whenever a Sensor
receives the newest SETUP message, the first time it saves info, and later it
always forwards it on BROADCAST. Even though the original SETUP messages are Sent
by the Node 0 approximately each 300 ms, then once the nodes receive it they start
forwarding it super fast, almost instantly, so the net traffic is basically
almost only setup messages. We will need to put timers on Nodes so that they do
not forward instantly. And the time of waiting to forward should be different for
each node so that they don't forward at the same times.


- SOLVED: Same length for SETUP and DATA messages, the Node 0 was receiving forwarded SETUP
messages and analising them as if they were DATA. Solved making the message_id of
DATA messages a uint8_t instead of uint16_t.
